# Simple MVC framework in Rust

For a school project we had to investigate different frameworks in which we
could implement MVC frameworks.

I choose Rust's [Iron](https://github.com/iron/iron) framework as one of my subjects
to research, because I write in PHP and JavaScript for my daily job, and wanted
to find something new.

In Rust, I couldn't find a clear example or framework that followed the MVC
design pattern, which is why I created this repo.

* Controllers: `src/controllers`
* Models: *Work in progress*
* Views: `src/views`

This repository contains the basics for an MVC-like web project in Rust, if I
choose Rust as my pick for this programming course, a fork will contain a working
application with multiple controllers, models and views.
